## Generating the dependency tree of a project
To generate the dependency tree of a project, use the `source-wand deptree` command.

There are two ways to provide a project to `source-wand`:

1. From a local directory: `source-wand deptree local <path-to-project-directory>`
2. From a git repository: `source-wand deptree git <path-to-git-repository>`
