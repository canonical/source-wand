# Installing source-wand

## Ubuntu

### Using the Snap
The easiest way to install `source-wand` is to use the `snap`.

```bash
sudo snap install source-wand --edge
```

Note that the present version of `source-wand` is on the `edge` risk. This means that there is not yet a guarantee of retrocompatibility between revisions.

When the API becomes stable enough, the `snap` will be promoted to `beta`, then to `stable`.
